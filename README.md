# Project Name

React Gallery

## Description

I took an array of images with descriptions and a number of likes and created a gallery which displays the images then displays the description when clicking the image.  Then I created a like button for each of the pictures and each time the button is clicked it adds one to the like counter which is displayed under the picture.
